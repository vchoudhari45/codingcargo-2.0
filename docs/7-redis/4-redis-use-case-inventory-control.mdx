# Redis Use Case: Inventory Control

This page outlines the design of an inventory control system using Redis. These notes are based on the RU101 Redis University course.


## Requirements

- A Ticket can be purchased only once.
- During the purchase flow, inventory needs to be reserved so that others don't buy the same ticket.
- If purchase does not complete, any reserved inventory needs ot be returned to the available pool.
- Customer wants to see their purchases.
