# Game Theory

This page provides links to solutions that use the Game Theory.

## Overview

Game theory is a mathematical discipline that models conflicting behaviors. Here are some of the games

### Tic Tac Toe
	- Players makes move alternatively
	- On a player's turn, they can mark a cell
	- The player who marks rows, columns, or diagonals is the winner


### Domineering 
	- Players makes moves alternatively
	- Player1 chooses two consecutive cells horizontally
	- Player2 chooses two consecutive cells vertically
	- The Player who runs out of moves loses

### Chomp 
	- Players makes moves alternatively
	- On a player's turn, they choose one of the remaining chocolate bars to eat
	- When a player eats a chocolate bar, they also remove all chocolate bars that are directly below and to the right of the eaten chocolate bar
	- The player who eats the last remaining chocolate bar (the one at the top-left corner) loses the game

### Hex
	- Players makes moves alternatively
	- On a player's turn, they place a stone of their color on an empty hexagon, aiming to create a path from one side of the board to the opposite side, while also blocking the path of the opposing player
	- The game ends when one player successfully creates a connected path of their colored hexes from one of their sides to the opposite side

### Take Away 
	- Players makes moves alternatively
	- Players take turns removing specified number of objects from the set during their turn
	- Player who removes last object from the set wins

## How to Spot These Problems

You can identify game theory problems if the problem requires you to:

- Game theory problems involve situations where individuals or groups (players) must make decisions that affect each otherâ€™s outcomes.
