# Deque

This page provides links to solutions that use the Deque approach.

## Overview

A deque (double-ended queue) is a linear data structure that allows insertion and deletion of elements from both ends, front and back. It's more flexible than a regular queue or stack, making it efficient for scenarios that require operations at both ends. 

## How to Spot These Problems

You can identify deque problems if the problem requires you to:

- Efficiently access, insert, or remove elements from both the front and the back of a sequence.
