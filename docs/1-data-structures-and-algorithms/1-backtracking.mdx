# Backtracking

This page provides links to solutions for problems that use the backtracking technique.

## Overview

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique used to solve problems by incrementally building candidates for a solution. 

For example, classic $\text{N}$ queen problem, for this problem we start by assigning each queen to one of the $\text{N}$ rows and use backtracking to adjust the placement if the current arrangement does not satisfy the conditions for placing 
$\text{N}$ queens on an $\text{N} \times \text{N}$ chessboard.


## How to Spot These Problems

You can identify backtracking problems:

- If the problem requires you to explore all possible outcomes.
- If the size of the input is very small.
