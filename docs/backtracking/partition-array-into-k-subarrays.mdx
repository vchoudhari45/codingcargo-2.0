# Partition Array Into K Subarrays

This page features a list of links to explanations and Java solutions for problems that involve partitioning an array into $K$ subarrays, using the Backtracking technique.


## How to Spot These Problems

Some problems simply call for a basic backtracking method to solve them. You can spot these by looking at the
the size of the input. Another clue is that the problem requires checking all possible outcomes before arriving
at the expected solution.
