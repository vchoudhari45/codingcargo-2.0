# Backtracking

This page provides links to solutions for problems that use the backtracking technique.

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique used to solve problems by incrementally building candidates for a solution.

## How to Spot These Problems

You can identify backtracking problems:

- If the problem requires you to explore all possible outcomes.
- If the size of the input is very small.

## Leetcode Problem Set
