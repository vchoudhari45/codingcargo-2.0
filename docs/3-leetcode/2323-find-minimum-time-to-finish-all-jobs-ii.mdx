# 2323. Find Minimum Time to Fini...

This page provides solutions for the leetcode problem [2323. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-time-to-finish-all-jobs-ii/description/).


## Problem Explanation 

The problem asks us to calculate the number of days required to complete all the jobs, given the time each job takes (represented by the $\text{jobs}$ array) and time each worker can work (represented by the $\text{workers}$ array). The solution must ensure that each job is assigned to exactly one worker, and each worker completes exactly one job.


## Solution

This problem can be solved using the Greedy technique. [More such questions can be found here](/data-structures-and-algorithms/greedy).

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    // Main method to calculate minimum time required
    public int minimumTime(int[] jobs, int[] workers) {
        // Sort jobs and workers arrays
        Arrays.sort(jobs);
        Arrays.sort(workers);
        
        int min = 0;

        // Iterate through jobs
        for (int i = 0; i < jobs.length; i++) {
            // Calculate days needed for current job and worker
            int days = jobs[i] / workers[i];
            if (jobs[i] % workers[i] > 0) days++;

            // Update min with the maximum of current days and previous min
            min = Math.max(min, days);
        }

        return min;
    }
}

## Complexity 

Let's say there are $\text{N}$ elements in a $\text{jobs}$ array.

#### Time Complexity 

Time complexity of $\text{O}(\text{N} \ \text{log} \ \text{N})$ for sorting both arrays and $\text{O}(\text{N})$ for calculating number of days required to complete all the jobs.

$$
\text{O}(\text{N} \ \text{log} \ \text{N})
$$

#### Space Complexity

The solution uses constant space.

$$
\text{O}(\text{1})
$$
