# Mutual Funds


A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. The fund is managed by professional money managers who make investment decisions on behalf of the investors.

There are two important things to consider when buying a mutual fund:
- Who is the sponsor of the AMC? This is to ensure you are dealing with credible names.
- Who is the fund manager? This is to ensure that your money is being handled by the right person.

## Terminology

Below are some of the mutual funds terminology,

### NAV

The Net Asset Value (NAV) of a mutual fund is the per share value of the fund's assets minus its liabilities. \
It represents the price at which investors can buy or sell mutual fund shares.

<br />
$$
\text{NAV} = \frac{(\text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities})}{\text{Total Number of Outstanding Shares}}
$$

### Open Ended Funds

When an Asset Management Company (AMC) starts a fund, they have the option to let that fund run for either a fixed period or indefinitely.

For example, I can start a fund today and let it run for three years. At the end of the third year, the fund will cease to exist, and the investor will be obligated to collect their money back, along with any profit or losses.

Funds with such defined timeframes are called closed ended funds. If a fund does not have an expiry date, it is called an open ended fund. For all practical purposes, it is generally better to deal with an open ended fund.


### Allotment Date

This is the date from which the fund commenced its operations.


### Regular Plan

The mutual fund distributor acts as the middleman between the Asset Management Company (AMC) and the investor. If a mutual fund distributor approaches you and sells you a mutual fund, it is typically a 'regular plan'. 

This means the distributor is entitled to receive a commission from the AMC for selling the fund to you. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this, it is important to understand that the commission ultimately comes out of your investment.


### Dividend payout

When you buy a stock and the company issues a dividend, you, as an investor, are entitled to receive that dividend. 
Similarly, when a fund manager buys the stock of a company and the company issues a dividend, the Asset Management Company (AMC) receives this dividend. 

Since the funds with the AMC belong to the investors, the dividend ultimately belongs to the investors as well. The dividend you are entitled to from the AMC is proportional to your investment in the fund. 

The AMC offers you two options: you can withdraw the dividend, or you can choose to reinvest the dividend amount and buy more units of the fund. The dividend payout option allows you to withdraw the dividend whenever it is paid. This option is now referred to as the “Payout of Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal” option.


### Exit load 

This is the amount of money you will have to pay at the time of withdrawal.

## Mutual Fund Categories

Primarily, there are five different categories of mutual funds 

### Equity Funds
Mutual funds that primarily invest in stocks of various companies to achieve capital growth.

### Focused Funds
Equity funds that invest in a limited number of stocks, usually not exceeding $30$, to focus on potential high returns.

### Dividend Yield Funds
Equity funds that invest in stocks of companies known for paying high dividends to generate regular income.

### ELSS Funds
Equity Linked Savings Schemes that offer tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, with a lock in period of three years.

### Debt Funds 
Mutual funds that invest in fixed income securities like bonds, treasury bills, and other debt instruments for stable returns.

### Index Funds
Mutual funds that replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P $500$, by investing in the same stocks in the same proportion.

### Arbitrage Funds 
Mutual funds that exploit price differences between the cash and derivatives markets to generate risk free profits.

## Mutual Fund Metrics

A mutual fund metric is a quantitative measure used to evaluate the performance, risk, and other attributes of a mutual fund.


### Future Value of Money

The future value of money can be calculated using the formula below: 

<br />
$$
\text{Future Value of Money} = \text{Current Value of Money} \times (1 + \text{Inflation} \%)^\text{Number of Years}
$$
<br />

For example, in $2020$, I have \$$2500$ in my account. Assuming an annual inflation rate stays at $4\%$ over the \
next $10$ years. After $10$ years, to purchase the same goods worth \$$2500$, I would need $2500 \times (1 + 0.04)^{10}$ \
 $\approx$ \$$3700$.

:::info
The same formula can be used to calculate compound interest. Instead of using the inflation percentage, use the interest percentage.
:::


### Absolute Return

If the investment period is less than one year, the return is called an absolute return, and it is calculated using the formula below.

$$
(\text{Ending Value} \div \text{Beginning Value}) \ - \ 1
$$

<br />
For example, on January $1^\text{st}$, $2020$, I invested \$$2500$ in a mutual fund. By July $7^\text{th}$, the value of the fund had increased to \$$3000$. The absolute return would be $20\%$.


### CAGR

CAGR or the Compound Annual Growth Rate measures the rate at which the investment is growing, and it is calculated using the formula below.

<br />

$$
\left[(\text{Ending Value} \div \text{Beginning Value})^{\large{\frac{1}{\text{Number of Years}}}}\right] \ - \ 1 
$$

<br />

For instance, I invested \$$2500$ in $2017$ in a particular mutual fund. Three years later, the investment had grown to \$$4000$. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) can be calculated as $\left[ \left( 4000 \div 2500 \right)^{\large{\frac{1}{3}}} \right] - 1 \approx 16.96\%$.


### XIRR

XIRR stands for Extended Internal Rate of Return. XIRR comes in handy when you make regular investments in a mutual fund over an extended period. Hence for SIPs, you need to use XIRR to measure the growth rate.

Excel has an XIRR function that you can use, function has following two inputs, 

- The series of cash outflows and the current value of the investment.
- The respective dates of cash flow and the date of the current value.


### Rolling Returns 

Rolling return is a method of calculating the annualized average return of an investment over a specific period, starting at different points in time. It helps in assessing the performance consistency of a fund by considering multiple overlapping periods, providing a more comprehensive view of how the investment performs over time.



For example Suppose you want to calculate the $3$-year rolling returns of a mutual fund over a $5$-year period. 

Here's how you would do it:

#### Data (Annual Returns):

- Year $1$: $10\%$
- Year $2$: $12\%$
- Year $3$: $8\%$
- Year $4$: $15\%$
- Year $5$: $9\%$

#### Calculate $3$-Year Rolling Returns:
- $1^{st}$ $3$-Year Period (Year $1$ to $3$): Return = $(1 + 0.10) × (1 + 0.12) × (1 + 0.08) - 1 = 32.5\%$
- $2^{nd}$ $3$-Year Period (Year $2$ to $4$): Return = $(1 + 0.12) × (1 + 0.08) × (1 + 0.15) - 1 = 39.58\%$
- $3^{rd}$ $3$-Year Period (Year $3$ to $5$): Return = $(1 + 0.08) × (1 + 0.15) × (1 + 0.09) - 1 = 35.85\%$

By calculating rolling returns, investors can evaluate the fund's performance stability and consistency over different periods, making it a valuable tool for long term investment analysis.

## Mutual Fund Benchmarking

Mutual fund benchmarking is the process of comparing a fund's performance against a standard index to evaluate its relative success.

### Beta 

The beta of a mutual fund is a measure of its relative risk compared with its benchmark, expressed as a number; beta can take any value above or below zero.

For example, the ABC fund has a beta of $0.95$, hence the fund is slightly less risky compared to its benchmark. If it had a beta of $1.2$, the fund would be considered more risky than its benchmark.

### Alpha 

Assume an equity fund generates a $12\%$ CAGR over three years, while its benchmark, the Nifty $50$, generates a $10.5\%$ CAGR for the same period. In this case, the fund is said to have outperformed its benchmark. The excess return relative to the benchmark is called the alpha. Alpha is a risk adjusted.


### Standard Deviation

The standard deviation of a stock or mutual fund represents its riskiness. It is expressed as an annualized percentage. The higher the standard deviation, the greater the volatility of the asset, and consequently, the higher the risk.

$$
\text{Loss} = \text{Investment} * (1 - \text{SD})
$$

$$
\text{Gain} = \text{Investment} * (1 + \text{SD})
$$

The larger the SD, the larger the possibility of loss or gains.


### Sharpe Ratio

Sharpe Ratio bundles the concept of risk, reward, and the risk free rate and gives us a perspective.

$$
\text{Sharpe ratio} = [\text{Fund Return} \ - \ \text{Risk Free Return}] \div \text{Standard Deviation of the fund}
$$

For example assume, there are two large cap funds Fund A and Fund B as below 


|Criteria				 |Fund A|Fund B|
|----------------|------|------|
|Return					 |$14\%$|$16\%$|
|Risk						 |$28\%$|$34\%$|
|Risk Free Return|$6\%$ |$6\%$ |

<br />

Let's apply the math for Fund A, We get 

$$
\text{Sharpe ratio} = [14\% - 6\%] / 28\% = 8\%/28\%= 0.29
$$

The number tells us that the fund generates 0.29 units of return (over and above the risk free return) for every unit of risk undertaken. Naturally, by this measure, the higher the Sharpe ratio, the better, as we all want higher returns for every unit of risk undertaken.


<br />

Let's apply the math for Fund B, We get 

$$
\text{Sharpe ratio} = [16\% - 6\%] / 35\% = 10\%/34\%= 0.29
$$

So it turns out that both the funds are similar in terms of their risk and reward perspective. And there is no advantage of choosing Fund A over Fund B.

### Sortino’s Ratio

The Sortino ratio is an improvement over the Sharpe ratio, where the denominator includes only the negative returns or downside risk.

The objective of the Sortino ratio is to estimate the excess return adjusted for downside risk only. Like the Sharpe ratio, the higher the Sortino ratio, the better.

### Capture Ratio

The capture ratio tells us, for a given period, to what extent the fund captured the positive returns of its benchmark and the negative returns of its benchmark.

This is the capture ratio of HDFC Top $100$, Direct, Growth fund on a $3$-year basis. It is available on Morningstar India website.

|Capture Ratio	 |Fund  |Category|Index |
|----------------|------|--------|------|
|Upside					 |$99$  |$92$    |$100$ |
|Downside				 |$119$ |$95$    |$100$ |

<br />

The fund has an upside capture ratio of 99, which implies that the fund has managed to capture 99% of the index’s upward movement. Likewise, the downside capture ratio is 119, which means that the fund has captured 119% of the index’s downward returns.
