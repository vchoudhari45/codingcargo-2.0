# Stock Options Greeks

Stock options greeks tell you how an option's price is expected to change when certain variable like time, the stock price, and implied volatility change.

## Delta

Delta is the first primary option Greek, which estimates how an option's price will change with a \$$1$ change in a stock price.

### Call options 

Call options have positive $(+)$ delta values. 

Let's say current the stock price is \$$100$, the option price is \$$5$, and delta is $0.50$. In this scenario, 

- If the stock price increases by \$$1$, then the option price becomes \$$5.50$.
- If the stock price decreases by \$$1$, then the option price becomes \$$4.50$.	

### Put options 

Put options have negative $(-)$ delta values. 

Let's say the current stock price is \$$100$, the option price is \$$5$, and delta is $-0.50$. In this scenario,

- If the stock price increases by \$$1$, then the option price becomes \$$4.50$.
- If the stock price decreases by \$$1$, then the option price becomes \$$5.50$.	


## Gamma 

Gamma is second primary option Greek, which estimates how an option's delta will change with a $1 change in stock price.


### Call Options 

Call options have positive $(+)$ Gamma values. Call deltas increase toward $+1$ when the stock price increases and decrease toward $0$ when the stock price decreases.


### Put Options

Put options have negative $(+)$ Gamma values. Put deltas increases toward $0$ when the stock price increases and decrease toward $-1$ when the stock price decreases.


## Theta

Theta is third primary option Greek, which estimates how an option's price will decrease with the passing of one day. All options have negative $(-)$ theta values.


## Vega 

Vega is fourth primary option Greek, which estimates how an option's price will change with a $1\%$ change in implied volatility. All option have positive $(+)$ vega values.
