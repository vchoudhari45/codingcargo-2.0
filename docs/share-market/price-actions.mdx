# Price Action

The market speaks its own language through price action and is composed of institutions such as

	- Banks
	- Brokerage Houses
	- Hedge Funds
	- Insurance Companies
	- Mutual Funds
	- Pension Funds

Institutions move market prices; retail traders or individual traders cannot move the market. Therefore, it's important to follow institutional moves.

## Market Phases

The market moves through three stages

	- Uptrend or Advancing
	- Downtrend or Declining
	- Consolidation - It is further subdivided into
			- Accumulation 
			- Distribution


### Accumulation 

The accumulation phase is characterized by large institutions starting to buy stocks.

###  Uptrend

The uptrend phase occurs when prices breaks out of the accumulation phase.

### Distribution 

The distribution phase occurs when prices rise significantly, and institutions start to square off their positions. This phase may resemble the accumulation phase.

### Downtrend

The downtrend phase occurs when prices break out of the distribution phase.
