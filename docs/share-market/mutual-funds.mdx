# Mutual Funds


A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. The fund is managed by professional money managers who make investment decisions on behalf of the investors.

There are two important things to consider when buying a mutual fund:
- Who is the sponsor of the AMC? This is to ensure you are dealing with credible names.
- Who is the fund manager? This is to ensure that your money is being handled by the right person.

## Terminology

Below are some of the mutual funds terminology,

### NAV

The Net Asset Value (NAV) of a mutual fund is the per-share value of the fund's assets minus its liabilities. It represents the price at which investors can buy or sell mutual fund shares.

$$
\text{NAV} = \frac{(\text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities})}{\text{Total Number of Outstanding Shares}}
$$

### Open Ended Funds

When an Asset Management Company (AMC) starts a fund, they have the option to let that fund run for either a fixed period or indefinitely.

For example, I can start a fund today and let it run for three years. At the end of the third year, the fund will cease to exist, and the investor will be obligated to collect their money back, along with any profit or losses.

Funds with such defined timeframes are called closed-ended funds. If a fund does not have an expiry date, it is called an open-ended fund. For all practical purposes, it is generally better to deal with an open-ended fund.


### Allotment Date

This is the date from which the fund commenced its operations.


### Regular Plan

The mutual fund distributor acts as the middleman between the Asset Management Company (AMC) and the investor. If a mutual fund distributor approaches you and sells you a mutual fund, it is typically a 'regular plan'. 

This means the distributor is entitled to receive a commission from the AMC for selling the fund to you. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this, it is important to understand that the commission ultimately comes out of your investment.


### Dividend payout

When you buy a stock and the company issues a dividend, you, as an investor, are entitled to receive that dividend. Similarly, when a fund manager buys the stock of a company and the company issues a dividend, the Asset Management Company (AMC) receives this dividend. Since the funds with the AMC belong to the investors, the dividend ultimately belongs to the investors as well.

The dividend you are entitled to from the AMC is proportional to your investment in the fund. The AMC offers you two options: you can withdraw the dividend, or you can choose to reinvest the dividend amount and buy more units of the fund. The dividend payout option allows you to withdraw the dividend whenever it is paid. This option is now referred to as the “Payout of Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal” option.


### Exit load 

This is the amount of money you will have to pay at the time of withdrawal.
