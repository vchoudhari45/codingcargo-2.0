# Stock Options

## Option Characteristics

All options have the following three main characteristics

### Expiration date

All options have an expiration date after which the option will have no value.

### Strike price 

If my call option has a strike price of \$$105$, I have the right to buy shares of the stock at the strike price of \$$105$ using the option.

### Contract multiplier

If an option is valued at \$$5$, it can't be bought for \$$5$, you will need \$$500$ because options generally represent the right to trade $100$ shares of stock. The number $100$ here is called the contract multiplier.


## Option Types

There are two main types of options

### Call Option

- Price of call option moves with stock price.
- Give the owner of call options the ability to buy $100$ shares of stock at the strike price upto expiration date.


## Option Pricing Law

The price of an option will always reflect the potential profit it can provide to the owner if they were to exercise the option.

### Example
Let's say I have a TSLA call option with a strike price of \$$800$, and the current TSLA stock price is \$$1000$, because I can use the call option to make a \$$200$ profit per share, the call option price must be worth \$$200$ or more.
