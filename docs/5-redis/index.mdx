# Redis 

Redis can be used as a database, cache, streaming engine, message broker, and more.

### Start Redis Docker Container 
To start Redis Stack server using the redis-stack-server image, run the following command in your terminal:

```java
docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 \
redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

:::info
You can also download sample data from the Redis University `.rdb` file as below and start a Redis server with sample data.
:::

```java
# download the sample data file
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/redis-university-assets/ru101/ru101.rdb.gz

# gunzip the file
gunzip ru101.rdb.gz

# start docker container
docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 \
-v "./ru101.rdb:/data/dump.rdb" \
redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

### Connect to Redis CLI 

You can then connect to the server using redis-cli, just as you connect to any Redis instance.
```java
docker exec -it redis-stack-server redis-cli
```


### To Stop Redis Container 

To stop Redis Stack server, run the following command in your terminal:

```java
# list all docker container running the redis/redis-stack-server image
docker ps -a | grep redis/redis-stack-server

# stop & remove container using containerId returned from above command 
docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>
