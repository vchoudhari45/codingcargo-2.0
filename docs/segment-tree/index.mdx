# Segment Tree

A Segment Tree is a type of data structure that allows for range operations, such as finding the total, minimum, maximum, distinct value within a range, in $O(log N)$ time complexity.

Additionally, it can perform point updates and range updates in $O(log N)$ time as well. Despite its name, a segment tree is actually stored as an array of elements.
