# Permutation & Combination


## Permutation
Permutations, refer to the arrangements of objects where the order matters.

$$
^nP_r= \frac{n!}{(n−r)!}
$$

<br />

## Combination
Combinations, on the other hand, represent selections of items where the order doesn't matter. 


$$
^nC_r= \frac{n!}{r!(n−r)!}
$$
