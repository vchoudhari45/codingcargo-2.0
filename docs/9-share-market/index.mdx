## Future Value of Money

It is very important to understand the future value of money. The future value of money can be calculated using the formula below: 

$$
\text{Future Value of Money} = \text{Current Value of Money} \times (1 + \text{Inflation} \%)^\text{Number of Years}
$$

For example, in $2020$, I have \$$2500$ in my account. Assuming an annual inflation rate stays at $4\%$ over the \
next $10$ years. After $10$ years, to purchase the same goods worth \$$2500$, I would need $2500 \times (1 + 0.04)^{10}$ \
 $\approx$ \$$3700$.

The same formula can be used to calculate compound interest. Instead of using the inflation percentage, use the interest percentage.
