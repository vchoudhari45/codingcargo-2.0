# Stock Options Greeks

This page provides an introduction to Stock Options Greeks. These are my notes from the youtube video on Stock Options Greeks.

Stock options greeks tell you how an option's price is expected to change when certain variable like time, the stock price, and implied volatility change.

## Delta

Delta is the first primary option Greek, which estimates how an option's price will change with a \$$1$ change in a stock price.

#### Call Options 

Let's say current the stock price is \$$100$, the option price is \$$5$, and delta is $0.50$. In this scenario:

- If the stock price increases by \$$1$, then the option price becomes \$$5.50$.
- If the stock price decreases by \$$1$, then the option price becomes \$$4.50$.

Call options have positive $(+)$ delta values.

#### Put Options 

Let's say the current stock price is \$$100$, the option price is \$$5$, and delta is $-0.50$. In this scenario: 

- If the stock price increases by \$$1$, then the option price becomes \$$4.50$.
- If the stock price decreases by \$$1$, then the option price becomes \$$5.50$.

## Gamma 

Gamma is second primary option Greek, which estimates how an option's delta will change with a $1 change in stock price.


#### Call Options 

Call deltas increase toward $+1$ when the stock price increases and decrease toward $0$ when the stock price decreases.

#### Put Options

Put deltas increases toward $0$ when the stock price increases and decrease toward $-1$ when the stock price decreases.
