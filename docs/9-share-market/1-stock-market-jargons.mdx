## Depreciation

Depreciation is an accounting method used to allocate the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives. When a company purchases a long-term asset such as property, plant, or equipment, it is typically not expensed in the year of purchase. Instead, the cost of the asset is allocated over the estimated useful life of the asset through annual depreciation charges.
