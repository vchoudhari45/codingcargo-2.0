## Depreciation

Depreciation is an accounting method used to allocate the cost of tangible assets over their useful lives. 

When a company purchases a long-term asset such as property, plant, or equipment, it is typically not expensed in the year of purchase. Instead, the cost of the asset is allocated over the estimated useful life of the asset through annual depreciation charges.

For example, if a company purchases a machine for \$$100,000$ with an estimated useful life of $10$ years, the company could choose to depreciate the machine using the straight-line method, which would allocate \$$10,000$ of the machine's cost to depreciation expense each year for $10$ years. This annual depreciation charge would be recorded on the company's income statement and reduce its net income, even though no actual cash is being spent.

Depreciation is important because it helps companies accurately reflect the declining value of their assets over time and ensures that expenses are properly matched with the revenues they generate. Additionally, depreciation expense can be used to reduce a company's taxable income, which can result in lower tax payments.

## Amortization

Amortization refers to the process of gradually reducing the value of an intangible asset over time. Intangible assets include things like patents, copyrights, trademarks, goodwill, and other intellectual property rights.

When a company acquires an intangible asset, it is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet. However, because intangible assets generally do not have a physical form and may have a limited lifespan, they need to be gradually written off or amortized over their useful life.

For example, if a company acquires a patent for \$$1$ million with an estimated useful life of $10$ years, it would be amortized over $10$ years, or \$$100,000$ per year. Each year, the company would record a \$$100,000$ amortization expense on its income statement to reflect the declining value of the patent.

Amortization is different from depreciation, which is the process of gradually reducing the value of a tangible asset over time. Tangible assets include things like buildings, machinery, and equipment, and they are generally depreciated over their estimated useful life.

## Share Outstanding

Shares outstanding refers to the total number of shares of a company's stock that are currently held by all of its shareholders, including both institutional and individual investors. This figure is used to determine a company's market capitalization, which is the total value of its outstanding shares.

Shares outstanding can fluctuate over time as a result of various factors, including share repurchases or issuances, stock splits, and mergers or acquisitions.

Let's say Company A has issued \$$1,000,000$ shares of stock to the public. Of those shares, \$$500,000$ are currently held by institutional investors and \$$200,000$ are held by individual investors, while remaining \$$300,000$ shares are held by the company itself as treasury stock. In this example, the total number of shares outstanding for Company A would be $700,000$ ($500,000$ held by institutional investors + $200,000$ held by individual investors). 

This figure is important because it determines the company's market capitalization, or the total value of its outstanding shares based on the current market price. For example, if the current market price for Company A's shares is \$$10$, its market capitalization would be \$$7,000,000$ ($700,000$ shares outstanding x \$$10$ per share).

In addition to market capitalization, the number of shares outstanding can also impact a company's earnings per share (EPS) calculation. EPS is calculated by dividing a company's net income by the number of outstanding shares. If a company has a high number of shares outstanding, each individual share represents a smaller portion of the company's net income, resulting in a lower EPS. Conversely, a company with a low number of shares outstanding will have a higher EPS.

## Institutional Ownership

Institutional ownership refers to the percentage of a company's outstanding shares that are held by institutional investors such as pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other financial institutions. Institutional investors often purchase large amounts of shares, and their decisions to buy or sell shares can have a significant impact on a company's stock price.

Institutional ownership is important for several reasons. First, it can provide an indication of the level of confidence that institutional investors have in a company's prospects for growth and profitability. If institutional ownership is high, it may suggest that these investors have done their due diligence and believe that the company has strong potential. On the other hand, low institutional ownership may signal that investors are skeptical about the company's future prospects.

## Number of Floating Shares

The number of floating shares refers to the total number of a company's shares that are available for trading on the open market, excluding shares that are held by insiders, such as company executives or major shareholders.

The number of floating shares is an important metric for investors to consider when evaluating a company's stock. This is because the level of available shares for trading can impact the stock's liquidity, or the ability to buy or sell shares quickly and without significant price impact. A higher number of floating shares typically means that the stock is more liquid, which can make it easier for investors to buy and sell shares without affecting the stock price too much.

## Short Interest as % of Float

Short interest as a percentage of float is a metric that represents the percentage of a company's float shares that have been sold short by investors who are betting that the stock will decrease in value. Short selling is a trading strategy where investors borrow shares from a broker, sell those shares on the market, and then hope to buy them back at a lower price to return to the broker, pocketing the difference as profit.

This metric can provide insights into the level of bearish sentiment or market expectations for a particular stock. A higher short interest as a percentage of float can indicate that more investors are betting against the stock, which can be seen as a negative sign for the stock's future performance.


## Price/Earnings (TTM)

Price/earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is a valuation metric used to measure the relative value of a company's stock price to its earnings per share (EPS). The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current market price per share by the earnings per share (EPS) over the last $12$ months, also known as the trailing $12$-month (TTM) period.

For example, Let's say a company reported net income of \$$10$ million in the first quarter, \$$15$ million in the second quarter, \$$12$ million in the third quarter, and \$$13$ million in the fourth quarter. The total net income for the past four quarters would be \$$50$ million. 

If the company has $10$ million outstanding shares, then the EPS (TTM) would be calculated as EPS (TTM) = \$$50$ million / $10$ million shares = \$$5$. Now, if a company's stock is trading at \$$50$ per share then P/E ratio would be $10$ (i.e. \$$50$/\$$5$).

The P/E ratio can be used as a valuation metric to compare the relative value of a company's stock to other stocks in the same industry or market. A high P/E ratio may suggest that the company's stock is overvalued compared to its earnings potential, while a low P/E ratio may suggest that the stock is undervalued.


## Price/Sales (TTM)

Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a valuation metric used to compare a company's stock price to its revenue per share. The P/S ratio is calculated by dividing the current market price per share by the revenue per share over the last $12$ months, also known as the trailing $12$-month (TTM) period.

For example, let's say a company generated total revenue of \$$1$ billion over the past $12$ months and has $100$ million outstanding shares. To calculate the revenue per share (TTM), you would divide \$$1$ billion by $100$ million shares, giving you a revenue per share (TTM) of \$$10$. Now, if a company's stock is trading at \$$50$ per share then the P/S ratio would be $5$ (i.e., \$$50$/\$$10$).

The P/S ratio can be used to compare the relative value of a company's stock to other stocks in the same industry or market. A high P/S ratio may suggest that the stock is overvalued compared to its revenue potential, while a low P/S ratio may indicate that the company's stock is undervalued.


## Price/Book

Price to book (P/B) ratio, also known as price to equity ratio, is a valuation ratio used to compare a company's current market price to its book value. It is calculated by dividing the current market price per share of a company by its book value per share.

Book value per share represents the amount of a company's assets that would be left over for shareholders if all its liabilities were paid off. It is calculated by subtracting a company's total liabilities from its total assets, and then dividing the resulting number by the total number of shares outstanding.

Let's say a company has a book value of \$$100$ million and $10$ million shares outstanding. This would give a book value per share of \$$10$.  If the current market price per share of the company is \$$50$, then the P/B ratio would be $5$.

This P/B ratio of $1.5$ indicates that the company's stock is currently trading at $1.5$ times its book value per share. If the P/B ratio is less than $1$, it indicates that the stock is trading at a discount to its book value, while a P/B ratio greater than $1$ indicates that the stock is trading at a premium to its book value.

## Price/Cash Flow

Price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio is a valuation ratio used to evaluate a company's current market price relative to its cash flow. It is calculated by dividing the current market price per share of a company by its cash flow per share.
