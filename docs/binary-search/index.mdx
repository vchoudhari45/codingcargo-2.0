# Binary Search

This page provides links to solutions for problems that use the binary search technique.

Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to search for a specific element in a sorted array or list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.


## How to Spot These Problems

You can identify binary search problems if the problem requires you to:

- Search for a specific element or target value in a sorted array or list.
- Determine the maximum or minimum value that satisfies certain conditions.
- Find the first or last occurrence of a particular element in a sorted array.
- Split an array or range into subarrays or subranges and solve subproblems within these divisions.
