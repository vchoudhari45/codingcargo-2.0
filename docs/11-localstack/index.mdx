## Overview

LocalStack is complete, localized AWS environment where developers can build, test, profile and debug infrastructure and code ahead of deployment to the cloud.

## Running Terraform on LocalStack

Install tflocal using below command

Create a terraform config file main.tf with below content
```hcl 
resources "aws_dynamodb_table" "food_store_foods" {
  name = "foodstore_foods"
  billing_mod = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key = "food_id"

  attributes {
    name = "food_id"
    type = "S"
