# LocalStack

## Overview

LocalStack is complete, localized AWS environment where developers can build, test, profile and debug infrastructure and code ahead of deployment to the cloud.

## Installing LocalStack
```java
docker pull localstack/localstack

pip install awscli-local

brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

## Starting LocalStack

You can start localstack using localstack command 
```java
localstack start -d
```

Or you can use docker command
```java
docker run --rm -it -p 4566:4566 -p 4510-4559:4510-4559 localstack/localstack
```

## Stopping LocalStack
```java
localstack stop

container stopped: localstack-main
```


## Running Terraform on LocalStack

Install tflocal using below command

```java
pip install terraform-local
```

Create a terraform config file main.tf with below content

```java
resources "aws_dynamodb_table" "food_store_foods" {
  name = "foodstore_foods"
  billing_mod = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key = "food_id"

  attributes {
    name = "food_id"
    type = "S"
  }
}
```

Now, you can initialize terraform local using below command.

```java
tflocal init
```

And then apply terraform configurations, to create a infrastructure in localstack
```java
tflocal apply
```

:::info
Use terraform instead of tflocal if you want to create infrastructure in cloud provider.
