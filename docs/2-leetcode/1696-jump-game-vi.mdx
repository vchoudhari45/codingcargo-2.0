# 1696. Jump Game VI

This page provides solutions for the leetcode problem [1696. Jump Game VI](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-vi).


## Problem Explanation

The problem requires us to calculate maximum score you can get in jump game with following rules.

You are initially standing at index $\text{0}$. In one move, you can jump at most $\text{k}$ steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. That is, you can jump from index $\text{i}$ to any index in the range $\text{[i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)]}$ inclusive. 

You want to reach the last index of the array $\text{index = n - 1}$. Your score is the sum of all $\text{nums[j]}$ for each index $\text{j}$ you visited in the array.


## Solution

This problem can be solved using the Deque data Structure. [More such problem can be found here](/data-structures-and-algorithms/deque).

```java
class Solution {
    // calculates the maximum result by choosing elements from the array.
    public int maxResult(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] score = new int[n];
        Deque<Integer> dq = new LinkedList<>();
        score[0] = nums[0];
        dq.offer(0);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            // remove elements from the front of the deque if outside the window
            while (!dq.isEmpty() && i - dq.peekFirst() > k) {
                dq.pollFirst();
            }

            // calculate the score for the current index
            score[i] = score[dq.peekFirst()] + nums[i];

            // remove elements from the back of the deque with smaller scores
            while (!dq.isEmpty() && score[dq.peekLast()] <= score[i]) {
                dq.pollLast();
            }

            // add the current index to the deque
            dq.offer(i);
        }

        return score[n - 1];
    }
}
```

## Complexity 

Let's say there are $\text{N}$ elements in an array.

#### Time Complexity 

Each index is visited only once, so time complexity will be, 

$$
\text{O}(\text{N})
$$

#### Space Complexity

At any given point deque will have $\text{N}$ elements, so space complexity will be, 

$$
\text{O}(\text{N})
$$
