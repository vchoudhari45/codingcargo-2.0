# 2279. Maximum Bags With Full...

This page provides solutions for the leetcode problem [Leetcode 2279. Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-bags-with-full-capacity-of-rocks/).


## Problem Explanation 

The problem asks us to determine the maximum number of bags that can be filled to their full capacity after adding extra rocks. The capacity of each bag is represented by the $\text{capacity}$ array, and the number of rocks already in each bag is provided in the $\text{rocks}$ array.
 

## Solution

This problem can be solved using the Greedy technique. [More such questions can be found here](/data-structures-and-algorithms/greedy).

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumBags(int[] capacity, int[] rocks, int additionalRocks) {
        int n = rocks.length;
        int[] requiredRocks = new int[n];
				
        //calculate requiredRocks array 
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            required[i] = capacity[i] - rocks[i];
        }

        //sort requiredRocks array
        Arrays.sort(required);

        //start filling bag with least requiredRocks first 
        int index = 0;
        while(additionalRocks > 0 && index < required.length) {
            if(additionalRocks >= required[index]) {
                additionalRocks -= required[index++];
            }
            else break; // break if additionalRocks can't fill current bag
        }
        return index;
    }
}
```

## Complexity 

Let's say there are $\text{N}$ elements in a $\text{rocks}$ array.

#### Time Complexity 

Time complexity of $\text{O}(\text{N} \ \text{log} \ \text{N})$ for sorting $\text{capacity}$ array and $\text{O}(\text{N})$ for calculating maximum number of bags.

$$
\text{O}(\text{N} \ \text{log} \ \text{N})
$$

#### Space Complexity

The solution uses $\text{O}(\text{N})$ space to calculate required rocks for each bag.

$$
\text{O}(\text{N})
$$
