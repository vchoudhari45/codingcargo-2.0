# 2591. Distribute Money To Maxi...

This page provides solutions for the leetcode problem [2591. Distribute Money to Maximum Children](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-money-to-maximum-children/).

## Problem Explanation

The problem is asking us maximize the number of children who receive exactly \$$8$ if we distribute the $\text{money}$ among $\text{children}$ under the following conditions:
	- All money must be distributed.
  - Everyone must receive at least 1 dollar.
  - Nobody receives 4 dollars.

## Solution

This problem can be solved using the Binary Search technique. [More such questions can be found here](/data-structures-and-algorithms/binary-search).

```java
class Solution {
    public int distMoney(int money, int children) {
        int lo = -1;
        int hi = children;
        while(lo < hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi + 1) / 2;
            if(isValid(money, mid, children)) lo = mid;
            else hi = mid - 1;
        }
        return lo;
    }

    private boolean isValid(int money, int maxChlidren, int children) {
        int remainingMoney = money - 8 * maxChlidren;
        int remainingChildren = children - maxChlidren;
        if(remainingMoney == 4 && remainingChildren == 1) return false;
        else if(remainingMoney < remainingChildren) return false;
        else if(remainingMoney > 0 && remainingChildren == 0) return false;
        else return true;
    }
}
```

## Complexity 

Let's say $\text{N}$ be the total amount of money to be distributed among $\text{K}$ children.
 
#### Time Complexity 

The time complexity is $\text{O}(\log \text{K})$ for searching the optimal solution using binary search.

$$
\text{O}(\log \text{K})
$$



#### Space Complexity

The solution uses constant space for storing binary search variables.

$$
\text{O}(1)
$$
