# 2064. Minimized Maximum of Pr...

This page provides solutions for the leetcode problem [2064. Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimized-maximum-of-products-distributed-to-any-store).


## Problem Explanation 

The problem is asking us to distribute product, given in a product array $\text{quantities}$, into $\text{n}$ stores such that each store is given at most a single product type but in any quantity. This distribution should try to minimize the maximum number of products a single store has.
 

## Solution

This problem can be solved using the Binary Search technique. [More such questions can be found here](/data-structures-and-algorithms/binary-search).

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimizedMaximum(int n, int[] quantities) {
        int lo = 1;
        int hi = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for(int i = 0; i < quantities.length; i++) {
            hi = Math.max(hi, quantities[i]);
        }

        while(lo < hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            int partitions = getPartitions(quantities, mid);
            if(partitions > n) lo = mid + 1;
            else hi = mid;
        }
        return lo;
    }

    private int getPartitions(int[] quantities, int required) {
        int partitions = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < quantities.length; i++) {
            partitions += quantities[i] / required;
            if(quantities[i] % required != 0) 
                partitions++;           
        }
        return partitions;
    }
}

## Complexity 

Let's say there are $\text{N}$ elements in an array, and total sum of all elements in an array is $\text{S}$.

#### Time Complexity 

The time complexity is $\text{O}(\log \text{S})$ for searching the optimal solution using binary search, and $\text{O}(\text{N})$ for checking if the array can be split into $\text{K}$ subarrays. 

Total time complexity will be, 

$$
\text{O}(\text{N} \log \text{S})
$$



#### Space Complexity

The solution uses constant space for storing binary search variables.

$$
\text{O}(1)
$$
