# 2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies

This page provides solutions for the leetcode problem [2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/fair-distribution-of-cookies/description/).

## Problem Explanation 

The problem is asking us to divide the cookies among $\text{K}$ children in such a way that the maximum number of cookies a single child gets is minimized.

## Solution

For this problem, we need to consider all possible distribution possibilities. Therefore, we use the backtracking technique. [More such problem can be found here](/data-structures-and-algorithms/backtracking).

```java
class Solution {
    private int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    public int distributeCookies(int[] cookies, int k) {
        backtrack(cookies, 0, new int[k]);
        return min;
    }

    private void backtrack(int[] cookies, int index, int[] dist) {
        if (index == cookies.length) {
            min = Math.min(min, max(dist));
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i < dist.length; i++) {
                if (dist[i] + cookies[index] >= min) continue;

                dist[i] += cookies[index]; 
                backtrack(cookies, index + 1, dist);
                dist[i] -= cookies[index];
            }
        }
    }

    private int max(int[] dist) {
        int maxValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < dist.length; i++) {
            maxValue = Math.max(maxValue, dist[i]);
        }
        return maxValue;
    }
}
```

## Complexity

Let's say there are $\text{N}$ bags of cookies to distribute among $\text{K}$ children.

#### Time Complexity 

Each of the $\text{N}$ bag has $\text{K}$ options to choose from.

$$
\text{O}(\text{K} ^ \text{N})
$$



#### Space Complexity

Since there are $\text{N}$ bags to assign to each child, the stack size for the backtracking will go upto $\text{N}$. Additionally, an array of size $\text{K}$ is needed to hold the distribution of bags among the $\text{K}$ children.

$$
O(\text{N} + \text{K})
$$
