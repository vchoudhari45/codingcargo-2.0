#  Rate Limiter

This page offers detailed explanations for rate limiter system design problems.

## Functional Requirement
	
	1. Rate limiting is done on the server side(Talk about server side and client side rate limiting)
	2. User's request will be rate limited by IP address, UserId etc.
	3. User should be able to configure granularity of rate limiting(Day/Hour/Minute/Second)
	4. System should drop rate limited request and not enqueue them.


## Non Functional Requirement

	1. System should be highly scalable 
	2. System should have low latency
	3. System should priorties high availability over consistency meaning config rule should be consistent across the system over time.

## Back of the Envelop Calculations

Let's say our system have to handle $10\text{k}$ services,

#### QPS 
	Let's say each service has $100$ write QPS and $1\text{k}$ read QPS \
	Total write QPS will be $10\text{k}$ Services $ * \ 100$ Write QPS per service $\approx 1\text{M}$ QPS

#### Config Storages 
	Let's say each service has $100$ config and each config is of $1\text{kb}$. \
	Total config storage required will be $10\text{k}$ Services $ * \ 100$ Config per service $* \ 1\text{kb}$ Storage for each config $\approx 1\text{gb}$

#### Rate Limiting Stats Storages 
	Let's say each service has $100\text{k}$ users \
	Total stats storage required will be $10\text{k}$ Services $ * \ 100\text{k}$ Users $* \ 8\text{bytes}$ of Storage for each stat $\approx 8\text{gb}$
