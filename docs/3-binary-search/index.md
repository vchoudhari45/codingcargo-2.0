# Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to search for a specific element in a sorted array or list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Imagine you're splitting \$$20$ among $2$ people and want to figure out how many get exactly \$$8$. The answer could be between $0$ to $2$. Instead of checking everything, using Binary Search makes it much easier.
