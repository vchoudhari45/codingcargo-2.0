# Dynamic Programming

This page provides links to solutions that use the Dynamic Programming.

## Overview

Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping sub-problems.

## How to Spot These Problems

You can identify dynamic programming problems if the problem requires you to:

- Optimize a solution by breaking it down into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.
