# Permutations

This page provides links to solutions that use the combinations.

## Overview

Permutations, refer to the selection and arrangements of items from larger group, where the order matters. The formula for calculating permutation is as below: 

$$
^\text{n}\text{P}_\text{r} = \frac{\text{n}!}{(\text{n}âˆ’\text{r})!}
$$

Where $\text{n}$ is the total number of items, and $\text{r}$ is the number of items to arrange.


## How to Spot These Problems

You can identify permutation problems if the problem requires you to:

- Generate all possible arrangements of a set or subset where the order of items matters.
