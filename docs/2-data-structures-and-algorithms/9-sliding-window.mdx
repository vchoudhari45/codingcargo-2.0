# Sliding Window

This page provides links to solutions that use the Sliding Window.

## Overview

A sliding window is a commonly used algorithmic technique that involves maintaining a subset of elements from a larger dataset to optimize computations over a sequence. It is often used in problems involving arrays or lists, especially when you need to compute something over every contiguous subarray of a fixed length.

## How to Spot These Problems

You can identify sliding window problems if the problem requires you to:

- Optimize over a fixed-size or dynamic window.

## Leetcode Problem Set

<DataTable notag="true" data=
{[
	{ id: 76, name: 'Minimum Window Substrings', tag: 'Sliding Window' },
]}  
/>
