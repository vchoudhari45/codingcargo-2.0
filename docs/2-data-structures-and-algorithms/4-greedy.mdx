# Greedy

This page provides links to solutions that use the Greedy approach.

## Overview

The greedy approach is an algorithmic technique that makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. It works by selecting the best option available at the moment without considering future consequences, aiming to reach the overall best solution.

## How to Spot These Problems

You can identify greedy problems if the problem requires you to:

- Find an optimal solution by choosing locally optimal solutions at each step.
